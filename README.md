# Prediction-on-customer-Lifecycle-value
This is an Insurance company data and we are intended to frame a regression model that can give us a regressed prediction of  the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
such that we can predict which of the customers (out of the total customers)  are the most profitable ones to this Automobile Insurance firm
Here target variable is 'Customer Lifecycle Value' which is a continuous in nature so a linear regression model has been prepared from this data.
Final model's accuracy has come as 82.88%
with an adjusted R-square value of 0.6331.
